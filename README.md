# DailyBible

There were unbelievably many times where I started a book but didn't end up finishing it simply because I forgot about it.
Daily Bible is a mobile application that alerts the users with daily notifications at customized times to read parts of the Bible.
The user is able to open the application and continue where they left off, or any specific page if they desire to do so.
The number of pages read by the user is tracked and can be viewed as a graph and this data is stored until the user has finished the whole text.
